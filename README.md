# Fetch
Fetch connects your Outlook and Office 365 calendar events to Alexa and Google Home.

Fetch is deployed as an Amazon Lambda function and connects to Office data through the Microsoft Graph.

The Fetch team would love to hear your feedback and ideas. You can open an issue here on Github or email as at [squatchsoftware@outlook.com](mailto:squatchsoftware@outlook.com).

Directions for setting up for Google Home can be found at:
